Grad Ascent Technologies was founded in 2010 by SenK and PreK, two passionate educators and AI researchers who believed in democratizing artificial intelligence education. What started as a small initiative in a co-working space in Bangalore quickly evolved into a pioneering EduTech company with a mission: to empower professionals and students with cutting-edge AI skills.

In its early days, Grad Ascent focused on delivering in-person workshops on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Their first flagship program, AI Foundations Bootcamp, launched in 2012, provided hands-on training in Python, data analytics, and neural networks. The overwhelming success of the program allowed the company to expand its curriculum and reach a broader audience.

By 2015, Grad Ascent had moved into a dedicated training center and introduced advanced courses in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Their industry-aligned curriculum attracted working professionals seeking career transitions into AI, as well as companies looking to upskill their employees.

The company's breakthrough came in 2018 with the launch of the AI Mastery Program, a structured curriculum covering ML, DL, MLOps, and the emerging field of Large Language Models (LLMs). With a strong focus on hands-on learning and real-world projects, this program positioned Grad Ascent as a leader in AI education.

By 2021, the company embraced online education, developing an interactive learning platform that offered live mentorship, real-world AI projects, and certification programs. This expansion allowed Grad Ascent to train thousands of learners across the globe, from aspiring AI engineers to industry professionals looking to specialize in AI-powered applications.

Today, Grad Ascent Technologies has trained over 50,000 learners and collaborates with top tech firms and universities. With headquarters in Chennai and satellite offices in Bangalore and Hyderabad, the company continues to lead the way in AI education, offering cutting-edge courses in Generative AI, Edge AI, and AI Ethics.

Despite its growth, Grad Ascent remains committed to its original mission: to make AI education accessible and practical for learners of all backgrounds. The company actively partners with research institutions and industry leaders, hosts AI conferences, and develops innovative learning methodologies to keep pace with the ever-evolving AI landscape.
